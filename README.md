## üß† Project Overview

This project aims to assist in early brain tumor detection by classifying MRI images into four tumor types. A custom CNN architecture was designed and trained using the Brain Tumor Classification MRI dataset from Kaggle. The model achieves strong performance on unseen data, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning in medical imaging.
